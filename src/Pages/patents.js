						<p> A method of joining of bulk metallic materials by microwave hybrid heating</p>
						<p>
							Present invention illustrates a novel method for joining of bulk metallic materials through
							microwave hybrid heating. Joining of bulk metallic materials has been carried out using
							microwave energy in a multimode applicator at 2.45 GHz and 900 W. Charcoal was used as
							susceptor material to facilitate microwave hybrid heating (MHH). Candidate materials in the
							form of coin and plate have been successfully joined through microwave hybrid heating within
							900 s of exposure time. A sandwich layer of similar composition of base material in powder
							form with approximately 0.5 mm thickness was introduced between the two candidate surfaces.
							Near complete melting of the powder particles in the sandwich layer does take place during
							the microwave exposure leading to metallurgical bonding of the bulk surfaces. A dense
							uniform microstructure with good metallurgical bonds between the sandwich layer and the
							interface was obtained. <br /> The method of microwave joining is simple and cost effective
							technique for joining of high thermally conductive bulk metallic materials in which the
							joint shows significant improvements in metallurgical and mechanical properties as compared
							with conventional welding.

							A method of developing metallic cladding/coating on metallic substrates by microwave
							irradiation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The major limitations of the available techniques of surface modification are high setup
							cost, high processing cost and high maintenance cost. Further, most of them are not
							environmental friendly. The current innovation of surface modification is focused on to
							overcome the limitations of the available techniques of surface modification, by using
							microwave radiations to develop an overlay of metallic, ceramic and cermet or combination of
							them on metallic substrate. However, all metallic materials do not absorb microwaves,
							rather, they reflect microwaves at room temperature. The microwave hybrid process has been
							developed in this invention for the development of clads on metallic substrates. The
							developed clads through hybrid heating shows good metallurgical bonding with substrate by
							partial mutual diffusion of element, absence of substrate-clad interfacial cracking,
							significantly low porosity inside clads. Clads exhibit good stiffness and good adhesion with
							the substrate. Multi directional cracks were observed at the clad surface; on further
							loading, the cracks get propagated into the clad thickness without getting peeled-off. This
							innovative process has the potential for applications as a surface modification technique.

							A natural polymer abrasive media for the abrasive flow machining and a process for
							preparation thereof
						</p>
						<p>
							In the present invention, a natural polymer based media has been developed that can be
							successfully used as an alternative abrasive carrier for AFM process. The performance
							analysis of the newly developed media and the existing media was carried out using a
							hydraulically operated, double acting horizontal AFM setup. It was found that the natural
							polymer media has been repeatedly showing excellent characteristics and enhanced performance
							(in terms of surface finish) while compared with existing media. The newly developed media
							is cost effective and yields an 82% saving in total preparation cost. The media is
							relatively easy to prepare; processing time is less than one twentieth of that of the
							commercially available media (w.r.t. polyborosiloxane). The major component of the new
							product is natural polymer and the carrier can be reused easily after separating from the
							blunt abrasives. Hence, the invention is environment-friendly.<br />
							The new invention is about a product, called carrier (media) that is an essential component
							of the ‘Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM)’ process. Thus, the manufacturers of parts with
							irregular shapes (e.g. pump impellers, turbine blades, surgery blades) and intricate
							internal features, often miniature (e.g., hydraulic valves, sleeves) shall be immensely
							benefited by the low product cost as well as the reusability of the product.

						<p> A method of microdrilling with microwaves through metallic concentrator</p>
						<p>
							This novel process can be used to drill hole in Perspex with diameter ranging from 277 μm to
							1 cm and depth more than 12 mm. This process is based on thermal ablation of the soft
							polymer by cold plasma generates by microwave irradiation at 2.45 GHz. The cycle time of
							drilling a single hole is 4 s while using concentrator (drill tool) of Ni-based steel of the
							size as per the hole requirement. The method can potentially provide a faster drilling
							solution in the micro-regime. The process drill holes with the aid of gravity control on the
							concentrator through a special feeding mechanism. Presently, the process cannot be used to
							drill hole in metallic material but the process is very much suitable to drill hole in
							selective material (non-metallic) without damaging the metallic part of any micro
							fabrication or micro-assembly.
							<br />The process can be utilized to drill micro-porous holes in polymer based material. The
							process can be used in the domain of micro-fabrication and micro-assembly of nonmetallic
							materials by drilling customized micro-holes like taper holes, different cross-section holes
							(patterned hole).

						<p> A device for in-situ microwave casting of metals and alloys</p>
						<p>
							The invention relates to a device for in-situ microwave casting of metals and alloys
							comprising a mold assembly containing target metal which is placed inside a microwave
							applicator having a cavity to accommodate a mold assembly containing target metal for
							microwave exposure and casting thereof. The device involves a microwave casting procedure
							wherein a metal is melted within a pouring basin according to microwave hybrid heating
							technique. The mold assembly consists of a pouring basin which can absorb microwave energy
							and conventionally heats the metal up to a material specific critical temperature of the
							metal. Further, microwave absorption dominates heating of the metal. The molten metal gets
							self-poured into the mold thorough a ceramic sprue. An insulating gasket around the mold
							assembly can be provided to further enhance the thermal heating efficiency of the system.
							Thus, the process reduces the risks related to transfer of molten metal in to the mold as
							compared to the prior art. Numerous experiments were conducted on various charge materials
							such as lead, aluminum, copper, iron and stainless steel for crucible and mold for in-situ
							microwave casting of the ferrous and non-ferrous metals. It has been demonstrated by the
							results that in-situ casting offers many advantages over other casting processes, which can
							be listed herein below.
							<br />The present invention eliminates the disadvantages associated with the known arts viz
							preheating requirements of the mold, enhances flowability of molten metal, improves control
							over cast properties and offers environment friendly casting route. It offers reduction
							energy requirements and loss of energy. Attainment of higher temperature of approximately
							2000 ºC with a relatively low power of 2-3 kW and heat treatment in the same mold and grain
							refinement is also possible.

							cell development with very less cost compared to the known art. Another field of application
							is in the fabrication of ceramic bolts which are costly. These ceramic nuts and bolts are
							used in high temperature and acidic environments. Turning and threading operations on glass
							and ceramic rods is possible using this setup. This device can be interchangeably used as a
